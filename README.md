## Game Structure and User Interface

The basic structure of the game consists of a single player ('#') trying to
reach the top row of the game board while avoiding patrollers ('P'), jumpers
('J'), chasers ('C'), and hiders ('H').

  * The game provides movement buttons for the player ('N', 'S', 'E', 'W') that
  move the player one square in the desired direction when selected.

  * The player is bound by the dimensions of the game board and does not wrap to
  the opposing boundary.

  * Six patrollers move horizontally (left or right) in two rows every other
  player turn.

  *  Three jumpers move to random locations within their respective rows every
  fourth player turn.

  * Two chasers move directly toward the player every third player turn.

  * Four hiders remain stationary but becomes invisible every other player turn.

## Instructional Objectives

The specific educational aims of this project include, but should not be limited
to, the following:

  * Provide introduction to inheritance in Java

  * Reinforce proper object-oriented design and development of Java classes
